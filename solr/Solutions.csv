Visualization of a Occupational Therapy Research Database,"The American Occupational Therapy Foundation (AOTF), in partnership with the American Occupational Therapy Association, has started to maintain a database of research in the field. We demonstrate how data visualizations can provide insights for building scientific networks, identifying scientific leaders for specific initiatives, and summarizing capacity to external stakeholder groups. We find that seven institutions have received 80% of total funding dollars. While research connected to Stroke is the largest overall, research related to Autism Spectrum Disorder has grown from none in early years to being the top diagnosis area. Overall there are 29 different research areas funded between 1982 and 2016 with an approximate funding of $153 million. The three most researched areas are Autism, Stroke, and Sensory integration areas. Insights are limited to current data available and do not reflect all research in occupational therapy. We demonstrated the need to expand upon the data collection efforts and use data based techniques for guiding future research",Solution,Research Paper,pdf,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eIGhv6tbMx2cvvotWX9LfsGXuygM7B-f0iRebNcjxUw/view,Peter Annable,28-May-16,"Tableau,Sci2,Gephi,OpenRefine","Temporal Analysis,Geospatial Analysis,Topical Analysis,Bipartite Networks",AOTA Research Database,,

"Globalization of the United States, 1789 - 1861","As described by Professor Dierks, the client, the goal of this visualization is to “project is to project historical data onto historical world basemaps, with an interactive menu to enable users to choose data, and with an interactive timeline to enable users to choose a particular historical moment or interval. A second aim is to create D3 visualizations in dynamic relation to the digital map",Solution,Research Paper,pdf,http://globalization1789-1861.indiana.edu/exhibit/worldmap/index.html,"Samantha Bartley, Meredith Gilstrap, Marco Roling, Ryan Werbeck",20-May-16,"D3JS,R",Geospatial Analysis,,,
