Spark runs MR jobs but the advantage is that it first places the data into RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) so the data is stored in memory and it is more quickly accessible.  The same MR jobs can be processed faster because the data is accessed in memory. It adds to that flexibility and speed with ability to write queries in Scala, Java (like Hadoop), and Python.  Also Spark’s allows applications to avoid costly disk accesses.",,<href>http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/<br>http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/11/putting-spark-to-use-fast-in-memory-computing-for-your-big-data-applications/<br>https://www.mapr.com/ebooks/spark/01-what-is-apache-spark.html<\href>
