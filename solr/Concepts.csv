K-Means Machine Learning,Concept,Machine Learning,Statistical Methods,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering,"K Means Clustering is a mathematical algorithm for reducing a set of information by creating a cluster of observed values based on the nears mean. The is also called ""vector quantization"". A classical use case for this would be to reduce the number of colors in a photo to a smaller color pallete for image compression.","When lossy compression or pattern recognition is desired. Reducing images sizes for analysis, or taking natural language strings and identifying the root concepts. Often used in combination with other techniques",When lossless compression is required.,<a href=https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/78>K Means Algorythm </a>,,

Feature Engineering,Concept,Application Design,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering,"“Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. Feature engineering is fundamental to the application of machine learning, and is both difficult and expensive. The need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning.”",When to Use,When NOT to use,<href>https://github.com/wehrley/wehrley.github.io/blob/master/SOUPTONUTS.md<br>http://mlwave.com/predicting-repeat-buyers-vowpal-wabbit/<br>http://machinelearningmastery.com/an-introduction-to-feature-selection/<br>http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/feature-engineering-tips-for-data-scientists<br>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-feature-selection-and-engineering/<br>http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/06/streamlining-feature-engineering.html<br>http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/<br>http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/#four<br>http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10/data-science-machine.html<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E<\href>,,
